# Description
This project involves creating a website that acts as a online book store called "Lookinabook". Our project implementation runs on a Spring Boot Web application. Thymeleaf provides the HTML templating, Lombok replaces boilerplate Java code, WET provides the CSS syling for the look of the pages, Jquery simplifies our Javascript code, Datatables provides an API for creating easy tables on our pages. As this is a project for COMP3005 "Database Management Systems", our backend interacts with a PostgreSQL server to store information about Books, Customers, Publishers, and Orders.
